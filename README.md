# About
I found this tutorial on bottom navigation menu ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHL6aeWUEQQ&list=WL&index=15&t=0s )
and I wanted to make some changes/improvements. 
I created re-usable variables to control the styling of the CSS rather than hard coding each value, moved the bar
to the side of the window if on a larger screen, and added some content along with interaction to the 
menu to have it function using simple Javascript.
